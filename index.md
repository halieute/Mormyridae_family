## About the Author

Dr. Souleymane Maman Nouri Souley is a Senior Research Scientist at Atlantic University's Department of Marine Biology, specializing in West African freshwater ecology. With over 6 years of field research in the Niger Basin, his work focuses on fish population dynamics, sustainable fisheries management, and climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems. He has published extensively on Mormyridae ecology, including seminal papers on length-weight relationships, diversity assessments, and exploitation parameters that form the foundation of this comprehensive volume.

As founding coordinator of the Niger River Conservation Initiative, Dr. Souley bridges scientific research with community-based conservation programs, ensuring that ecological insights translate into tangible protection strategies for West Africa's vital freshwater resources.

## Acknowledgments

This research was made possible through the generous support of:
- National Science Foundation Grant #[Number]
- Diffa University Research Initiative
- Niger River Conservation Network

Special gratitude to field research teams from Atlantic University, local fishing communities along the Niger River who shared invaluable traditional ecological knowledge, and colleagues who provided taxonomic validation and statistical consultation.
